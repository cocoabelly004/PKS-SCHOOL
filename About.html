        <h1>CBSE curriculam.</h1>
        <p>Being a CBSE school in Bangalore, we understand the importance of nurturing students to be the best versions of themselves. Our SHARPER philosophy, which encompasses five core foundations, provides a secure environment for students to blossom. Pks school leaves no stone unturned in providing world-class facilities and personalized attention, helping students become confident and self-assured.

            <li>Qualified teaching staff.</li>
            <li>Computer Aided Learning.</li>
            <li>Arts and sports program and more.</li> <br>
           <span> The education sector is undergoing fast changes during this present century. At PKS school we ensure to provide children with an all-round development having an equal emphasis on academics, sports, arts and other social activities. With the revision of curriculum and demand for professional skilled teachers for all aspects of the schooling, there has been a huge change in the profile of teachers being recruited. Further, we adhere to a lot of safety protocols which again calls for the employment of more ground force and better facilities. At PKS, we have believed that keeping our quality intact, we can specialise our resources being offered to our students, by upgrading our assets from time to time. We have developed a model at our school wherein we try to minimize the cost across curriculums by ensuring all students are a part of all the activities and reduce the burden on parents for not charging parents additionally for any activities. Instead of spending on additional tuition classes or other sports & art activity classes, we are able to provide a one-point solution for all our parents.</span></p>

        <p>Our vision is based on hard work, open communication, a strong emphasis on team work and a high level
            of responsibility. This visionary culture allows and emphasizes our wards not only to adopt the present day
            challenges but also individual responsibilities to the society and our nation at large.
            Learning should be based on doing things and not merely knowing things. Until and unless learning
            solutions relate to real life and motivate the learner to acquire and apply the knowledge the whole process
            will remain superficial. Any institution worth its name looks to optimize the productivity of global leaders.
            Our institution has set specific objectives and planned activities for achieving excellence in all spheres of
            education.
            The service of the institution in creating personally mature, professional equipped and service oriented -
            graduates is really worth mentioning. We strongly believe in academic excellence and do not compromise on
            teaching standards or discipline. These three things are spring boards on which we operate.
            People who feel good about themselves produce good results and people who produce good results feel
            good about themselves. We also believe in total learning and sharing. </p>
